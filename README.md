# XIV-BattleMusicShuffler

This is a work-in-progress plugin for FFXIV Dalamud to have music of your own choice play when in combat instead of the default music.

The plugin will pick a song at random in the appropriate music resources directory (TBD on exactly where that will be - I'm still working on it and this is far from ready to be used by real people).
